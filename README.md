- Bugs:
There was a bug where the success page from the form would throw a 404 error. After much troubleshooting, I realized that the action in the form was directed to "/success.html" and not "success.html".

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - on the left is a menu, find pages and open it
  - under Branch, it will say "GitHub Pages is currently disabled. Select a source below to enable GitHub Pages for this repository"
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, press the save button on the right
  - Now the message under Branch should read "Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the main branch." 

## How to Fork

2. Locate the repository 
3. Click on the 'Fork' button in the upper left.
